## How did I get into Tech

- Went to UVU in 2016

- Became disenfranchised with the traditional education model

- I was entrepreneurial so I decided I should learn to code to be better equipped to solve the problems I wanted to solve

- Graduated from Bottega in spring of 2017

- First internship 3 months out of bootcamp

- Almost 3 years into my career I landed my dream job at Homie and that is where i'm at today
