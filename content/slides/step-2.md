## Develop a portfolio

- Your last job is what matters
    - When you don't have technical experience a strong portfolio grabs attention
    - Show me what you can build not what you have learned

- Breaking out of tutorial hell
  - small steps
  - ask question that lead to action
  - give yourself permission to fail
